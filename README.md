# Yahtzee
This is a solo version of the classic game Yahtzee, implemented using the raylib 3D library and written in C++ 20.

How to Play
The objective of Yahtzee is to score the highest number of points by rolling five dice to make various combinations.
On each turn, you can roll the dice up to three times. After each roll, you can choose to keep some dice and reroll the others.
After three rolls or when you decide to stop, you must choose a category to score your dice in.
The game includes all the standard Yahtzee categories, such as Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes, Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Yahtzee, and Chance.
The game will automatically calculate and keep track of your score.
The game ends when all categories have been scored.

The game is playable on your web browser:
